1.Two Sum
Key is to use the Unordered_map which is in the "boost library"(see also http://blog.csdn.net/huang_xw/article/details/7933814).

Note that the complexity of unordered_map is o(1). It is thus better to use unodered_map instead of map(STL), whose complexity is o(logn). This performance difference is caused by different implementation. Unordered map used hash map, while map(STL) simply used binary tree structure.

To see detailed comparision between map and unordered_map please refer to http://blog.csdn.net/orzlzro/article/details/7099231.(Something about bucket)

=======================================

2.Add Two Number
The key to the fastest solution is to figure out how to deal with different length problem, i.e. len(l1) != len(l2). The first intuition was to us l1 to store the result, whhich is lack of consideration. The reasonale solution is to declare a new variable to store the result, while use l1 as a templet and use l2 when l1 is used up. In this way, the total length of l1 and l2 must be greater or equal to the length of the sum of l1 and l2.(Very important, e.g. 9 + 9 = 18)

Also, remember to take the NULL list into account.

=======================================

3.Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
One simple solution is to compute the max length without repeating using every possible start position(0 to s.length()-1), which costs o(n^2) time.

But if we look it from a different angle, we will find that one only needs to compare three value:
	1) from the start of the string to the first repeated char.
	2) every length between two repeated char.
	3) the last repeated char to the end of the string.
	e.g. for string "abcdbxyz", we need to consider "abcd", "cd", "bxyz", and get the answer of 4.

To do this, we need a map which records the index each char appears in the string. It's a little tricky in the code(use start as -1) but only requires o(n) time complexity:)

4.Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Too hard for me. Solve this later.

=======================================

5.Longest Palindromic Substring
Scan the string one time and take each position as the pivot of Palindromic substr. This is done by set "start" and "end" variable to i and do start++, end-- to enlarge the palindromic substring. The key is how to deal with consecutive char, such as "sss". Actually, we can ignore the repetition by moving the end to the last repeated position. This is save because any number of a repeat char will form a string that is definitely polindromic.

Again, remember to take the empty string into consideration by checking s.empty().

One question: What is the time complexity of the algorithm? o(n^2)?

=======================================

6.ZigZag Conversion
This problem is easy as you can find out the mathematical pattern in so many many ways. However, I prefer another method which is quite straight forward. First we should have a number of "numRows" strings. Then for each column, we simply store them in each string one by one, according to the direction "delta". In the end, we concatenate the strings and get the zig-zag converted string.

Remember!!! Consider the empty string and the case where numRows=1!!!!!!

=======================================

7.Reverse Integer
Simple problem. Just remember to use the INT_MAX and INT_MIN to avoid overflow.

=======================================

8.String to Integer(atoi)

=======================================

9.Palindrome Number
Your first consideration should be again the exceptional case: Can a negative number be palindromic? No.

Then you can consider how to solve the problem. You should be familiar with how to get the most left and right digit from x.

p.s. just ignore the "without extra space". What is an "extra space"??

=======================================

11.Container With Most Water
The answer to this quesiton is a little tricky. We start from check the maximum area when we select the bottom length as len = (height.size() - 1 - 0). Clearly, the maximum area possible is len1 * max(height[0], height[-1]). Suppose height[0] is bigger, so we decide to select height[0].

Then we check the case where length equals to len2 = len1 - 1. Their are two options available: from 1~height.size()-1, or from 0~height.size()-2; Consider the second opention, where we select height[0]~height[-2]. The possible maximum area is len2 * height[0](regardless of whether height[0] is bigger than heigh[-2] or not), which is in anyway smaller than len1 * height[0].

So we only need to select between len1 * height[0] or len2 * max(height[1], height[-1]). As we compare on and on, we can find that everytime after comparision, we just move the biggher line by one.

Algorithm: cwmw
Input:	height: contains a series of vertical lines of different height.
Param:	maxArea: current maximum area;
		l: left bound index;	r: right bound index.
maxArea = 0;
l = 0; r = 0;
while(l <= r)
begin
	tempArea = (l-r) * height[ height[l] < height[r] ? l++:r--];
	if tempArea > maxArea
	begin
		maxArea = tempArea;
	end
end

The time complexity is o(n).
